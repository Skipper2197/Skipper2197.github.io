            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>Seals were exposed to heavy hunting pressure during the early 20th century and during the 1960s they suffered from impaired reproduction linked to environmental 
                toxins such as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane). The environmental toxins caused damage to the seals' reproductive organs,
                which resulted in many females becoming sterile
            </p>
            <p>Bans on the use of PCBs and DDT in the late 1970s improved the situation for the seals, and since the mid-1980s the number of seals has been increasing again.
                compared to the estimated population size in 1900 of approximately 100,000 grey seals, today's population is still at a relatively low level.
            </p>
            <p>Knowledge of the development of numbers and distribution is important for the management of fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and for management decisions regarding grey 
                seal hunting.

            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to examine how seal populations in Sweden have recovered since historic declines caused by hunting and environmental toxins, and 
                to analyze how their distribution and mortality patterns vary across space and time. Understanding these trends helps inform sustainable fish stock management and conservation 
                decisions in the Baltic Sea.

            <h2>Dataset Limitations</h2>
            <p>Monitoring of seals is performed by counting seals from land, ship, or airplane, which may lead to underestimation or overestimation of actual populations.</p>
            <p>Therefore, each data point is the observation point, not the exact location of every individual seal.</p>
